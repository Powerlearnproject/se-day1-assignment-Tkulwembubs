Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering involves the designing, development, testing, deployment and maintenaince of software.
It focuses on creating reliable, scalable, and efficient software solutions through structured processes, methodologies, and best practices. Solves complex problems through structured development.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The Birth of Software Engineering (1968) – NATO Conference
   Development of structured programming, software lifecycle models, and engineering principles.
3. The Rise of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) – 1980s
   Encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, making software modular, reusable, and scalable.
5. The Emergence of Agile & DevOps – 2000s & Beyond
   Agile promotes iterative development, continuous feedback, and adaptability, significantly improving project success rates.
   Later, DevOps emerged, integrating software development and IT operations, emphasizing automation, continuous integration (CI/CD), and faster deployment cycles.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirement Analysis – Understanding the needs of stakeholders and defining functional and non-functional requirements.
Planning – Estimating project scope, cost, timeline, and resources while identifying potential risks.
Design – Creating system architecture, data models, and user interface design based on requirements.
Development (Implementation) – Writing code using programming languages, frameworks, and tools to build the software.
Testing – Identifying and fixing bugs through unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT).
Deployment – Releasing the software for users, whether through local installation or cloud-based services.
Maintenance & Updates – Providing ongoing support, fixing issues, and adding new features based on user feedback.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall - Best for Structured, Predictable Projects.
Example: Building an Embedded System for an Airplane
Hardware and software integration require a precise plan.
No room for frequent iterations due to safety regulations.
Agile - Best for Fast-Changing, User-Driven Projects
Example: Developing a Mobile App (E.g., Social Media Platform)
Features may need to change based on user feedback.
Frequent updates and improvements are expected.
Agile allows continuous iteration and testing.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A Software Developer is responsible for designing, coding, testing, and maintaining software applications.
A backend developer would focus on designing the database schema, implementing authentication, and building RESTful APIs, while a full-stack developer would handle both backend and frontend components.
A QA Engineer ensures that the software meets quality standards before deployment.
A QA Engineer would test user authentication, database queries, and UI responsiveness to ensure that applicants and recruiters can use the system smoothly.
A Project Manager oversees the software development process, ensuring timely delivery and effective communication between teams.
Project Manager would set milestones for database design, API development, and frontend integration while ensuring the team stays on track.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
An IDE is a software application that provides tools to help developers write, test, and debug code efficiently.
Code efficiency + productivity + Debugging + Testing + Project Management + Integration with tools.
A VCS is a tool that tracks changes in code, allowing multiple developers to collaborate and manage versions efficiently.
Code collaboration + Version tracking + Branching and merging + Backup + Security.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Managing Complexity in Large Codebases, Microservices and clean codde
Debugging and fixing bugs, TDD-test driven development
Rapidly changing technologies, Developer communities and Hands-on experience
Time management and Meeting Deadlines, Agile and task management
Version Control conflicts, Git merge tools
Security Vulnerabilities, Authentication and authorization mechanisms, update dependencies and security audits
Handling Performance issues, indexing, caching, proper normalization, profiling tools and load testing 

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing ensures individual components function correctly.
Integration Testing ensures that different components of the system work together.
System Testing verifies the software's overall behavior and compliance with specifications.
Acceptance Testing ensures the system meets user and business expectations before release.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Refers to the process of designing and refining the input, to elicit the most accurate, relevant, and useful responses. 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
"Tell me about Spring Boot."- Vague Prompt
Better said, Can you explain how to set up a basic REST API using Spring Boot, including how to configure the application and create a simple endpoint?
It  will generate a better answer because it is more concise, clear and specific so it will provide a context- driven answer.
